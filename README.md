What the $#@! Should I Cast On? 
A random idea generator for knitters/crocheters implementing the Ravelry API.

Users can use OAuth 1.0a to connect to their Ravelry account, which will import their queue to the app. The homepage displays a randomly generated queued pattern with a photo, a link to the Ravelry page for the pattern, and the option to click a button to generate a new random pattern.

Future plans include:
* a default homepage with patterns for users who aren't yet authenticated through OAuth, or do not have Ravelry accounts
* a carousel/slider in place of a static pattern image that will allow users to rotate through the photos associated with that pattern

As of right now I don't know the timeline on whether/if Ravelry will upgrade to OAuth 2.0; if that happens some major refactoring will need to occur. (22 Apr 2015)
